# Shopify Front End Developer Intern Challenge - Summer 2022

## Challenge Description

This is my submission for the Spacestagram: Image-sharing from the final frontier. It was enjoyable to work with Nasa's API and design an intuitive ui for users to interact with. The App fetches random images and gives the user the ability to like and copy the image's url to share with others. I also implemented a loading state while Nasa's API returns the data.

## Technologies used

For this project, I used React as my frontend framework and Chakra UI to style my components. The app can be accessed [here](https://zkaptan.github.io/Spacestagram/). I hope you enjoy!
